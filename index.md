title: Mathematics of Evolution
---

> **Spring 2023--Simon Fraser University**

## Course Overview
Much of our understanding of evolution, the process shaping the beautiful biological diversity in our world, is grounded in equally elegant mathematics.  In this course we will cover the mathematical description of evolution. Involving a wide range of topics, from the analysis of non-linear dynamics to stochastic processes and partial differential equations, this course will challenge you to take mathematical principals and apply them to the natural world.  Throughout this course we will focus particularly on addressing important contemporary existential questions with mathematical models, for example applications of evolution to conservation and public health.
